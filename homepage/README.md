# VR-video-website

Access the main page: https://rawgit.com/HarryXu12138/VR-video-website/master/Main.html

Known bug: Due to some issue for rawgit, when access the webpage through rawgit the menu button will not display properly.
Access the webpage from my homepage will be work.(http://homepages.rpi.edu/~xuj10/goawayfiles/test/Google%20Cardboard/Main.html)

This is a website to show the videos we take.
A simply usage of material design. May add some more things in the future.

For now I'm transfering all the pages to new framework. So maybe the pages looks odd sometimes.
