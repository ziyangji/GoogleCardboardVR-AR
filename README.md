# VR/AR/RPI

## Description

Google Cardboard VR/AR is a project designed by RCOS (Rensselaer Center for Open Source) students. The objective is to implement A-Frame to create VR scenery of RPI. Other libraries such as Google Maps API are also used in this project. Users can use VR set to view 360 scenery. Other contributors are also welcome to submit their own 360 videos or images. Please contact us via email below. Besides, we also contribute to A-Frame to solve issues on https://aframe.io/. In future, we will also help Prof. Ruiz at RPI to build AR program.
