# VR/AR/RPI

## Description

Google Cardboard VR/AR is a project designed by RCOS (Rensselaer Center for Open Source) students. The objective is to implement A-Frame to create VR scenery of RPI. Other libraries such as Google Maps API are also used in this project. Users can use VR set to view 360 scenery. Other contributors are also welcome to submit their own 360 videos or images to introduce RPI.

This is a project to utilize Google Cardboard to contribute to  https://aframe.io/ and to the source code here.
We will record several videos to introduce RPI and Troy with VR technology. The videos are scheduled to be delivered on Google Cardboard to public according to the Timeline and Milestones below. Besides, we will contribute to open project -- aframe.io. It is optional but encouraged to build our AR software for Prof. Ruiz, which can improve our overall capability of programming and prepared for further development in AR/VR using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc.
